  # Paper Airplane Numerical Study
  Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Reece Passons

  ## Summary of Findings
 ||Velocity|Flight Path Angle|
 |---|---|---|
 |Nominal|3.55|-0.18|
 |Minimum|2.00|-0.50|
 |Maximum|7.50|0.40|

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.
